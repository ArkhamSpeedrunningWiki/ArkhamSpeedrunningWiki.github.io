# How to Contribute to the Wiki
There are three major things you can do to contribute:
* Make note of any issues you see
* Add/update content
* Development

# Issues
This is the easiest way to help out. If you notice anything about the site that is broken, or any information listed that isn't correct, you can either send [ShikenNuggets](https://www.speedrun.com/user/ShikenNuggets) (current maintainer of the Wiki) a direct message describing the problem (Discord is the most reliable way to contact him, but he checks all his other social media as well), or you can go to the site's [Github page](https://github.com/ArkhamSpeedrunningWiki/ArkhamSpeedrunningWiki.github.io) and create an Issue there. Using GitHub is preferable as this allows you to check if the issue has already been reported, and also makes it easier for us to keep track of everything that needs fixing.

Adding an Issue to GitHub is very easy. If you don't already have one you'll need to create  a GitHub account and login. Then, go to the [GitHub page for the wiki](https://github.com/ArkhamSpeedrunningWiki/ArkhamSpeedrunningWiki.github.io), and select the "Issues" tab. From there, click the green "New issue" button. Give your issue a Title, and in the comment box describe the issue with as much detail as possible. You can include screenshots, video links, anything you may think is relevant. When you're done, click "Submit new issue".

# Adding or Updating Content
If you have some information that you  would like to add to an existing page, this is also very easy to do through GitHub. From the [GitHub page for the wiki](https://github.com/ArkhamSpeedrunningWiki/ArkhamSpeedrunningWiki.github.io) in the "Code" tab, find the page that you would like to edit and click on it (our naming conventions are pretty wacky right now, but the content will usually be in a .md file). On the right side of that page, you'll see a pencil icon that says "Edit this file" when you hover over it. Make whatever changes you would like to make.

When you're done, scroll down to the bottom where it says "Propose file change". Describe the changes you made (feel free to leave the optional extended description empty) and click the "Propose file change" button. This will take you to a "Comparing changes" button. From here, click "Create pull request", fill in some more information if you feel it's necessary, click "Create pull request" again and you're done! One of the wiki maintainers will then review and push your changes.

If you would like a new page to be created, add a new Issue for it or contact [ShikenNuggets](https://www.speedrun.com/user/ShikenNuggets).

# Development
If you're familiar with web development or design and would like to help develop the wiki itself, contact [ShikenNuggets](https://www.speedrun.com/user/ShikenNuggets) and we'll get you added as a collaborator. Beyond that, you probably know your way around GitHub well enough to figure out the rest ;)
