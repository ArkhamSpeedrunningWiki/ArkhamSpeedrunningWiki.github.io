**TL;DR**: Spanish is the fastest language for every full-game category, and French is fastest for HQR.

There are a few points in the game where playing on a different audio language results in dialog ending faster, and allowing you to progress through the game faster. You can view a [full spreadsheet detailing all known language differences here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IKkIDsWLHIBuIRkccrBSSW0kj0DUEJzlh97NLzSERkw/edit#gid=0).

**How to Change Language**
To change the language on the PC version of the game, navigate to the game's configuration folder in

"%USERPROFILE%\Documents\WB Games\Batman Arkham City GOTY\BmGame\Config\"

and open "UserEngine.ini" in the text editor of your choice. In that file, find the line (should be line 31) that says

"Language=Int"

and change the language code to the one desired. For the purposes of taking advantage of the language differences, you must choose a setting that results in non-English audio. Interface language only makes one minor difference and is largely irrelevant. The 5 audio languages available are English (Int), German (Deu), Spanish (Esn), French (Fra) and Italian (Ita).

Here are all known language codes:  
Int = "International", Full English. Unrecognized language codes will default to this.
Deu = Full German.
Esm = Spanish interface, English audio.
Esn = Full Spanish.
Fra = Full French.
Ita = Full Italian.
Jpn = Japanese interface (at least in theory, the text doesn't work for me), English audio.
Kor = Korean interface (in theory, same deal as Jpn), English audio.
Pol = Polish interface, English audio.
Por = Portuguese interface, English audio.
Rus = Russian interface, English audio.
