# Framerate/Zips

All console versions of Arkham Origins run at 30fps by default. The PC version is uncapped by default, if Vsync is disabled, it can be capped manually using [.ini file edits](https://arkhamspeedrunningwiki.github.io/page.html?page=Guides/Origins/FPS)

# Butterfly Gliding

Butterfly gliding is only doable on keyboard and mouse, therefore, it is not doable on any console version.

# Mouswheel

On the PC version the mouswheel can be bound to **_quickfire_** gadgets, this is done through the 'controls' settings from within the game itself without any .ini file edits.

This a list of gadgets that can be quickfired using the mousewheel:
- Batarang (Gadget 1)
- Batclaw (Gadget 2)
- Explosive Gel (Gadget 3)
- Triple Batarang (Gadget 4)
- Glue Grenade (Gadget 5)
- Smoke Bomb (Gadget 6)
- Concussion Detonator (Gadget 11)

The mousewheel can also be bound to **_select_** a specific gadget.

# Animation Cancels

All animation cancels that are possible on PC are possible on console, and are actually easier on console, due to the lower framerate.
These include:
- Door cancels
- Ground takedown cancels
- Silent takedown cancels

# Bane Hideout Glide

Bane hideout glide is _extremely_ difficult to do on controller, if not outright impossible. Even if it were to be done, it would not be of any benefit on console, as doing it will require at least one butterfly glide to be performed to be able to finish the run, which, as stated before, is not possible on controller.
